For convenience when testing there may be several different test suites 
corresponding to the same module.  To use funit, these would have to be renamed 
to $MODULE.fun when generating the code (which will also require copies/symbolic 
links to the module code and dependencies with a *.f90 file type)

SUITE			MODULE			TEST
initGrid.fun            initialisation		momentum grid setup
dispersions.fun		dispersions		fine and coarse grid dispersions
