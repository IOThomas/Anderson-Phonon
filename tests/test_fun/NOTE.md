Notes on generating test code from .fun files 
================================================= 

For convenience when testing there may be several different test suites 
corresponding to the same module.  To use 
[funit](https://github.com/kleb/nasarb/tree/master/funit), these would have to be 
renamed to `$MODULE.fun` when generating the code (which will also require copies 
of the module code and dependencies with a `*.f90` file type).

Note that it seems necessary to add the module dependencies by hand to the 
`$MODULE_fun.f90` code generated by funit for the test suite to compile fully.

The make files generated and stored in the `test_code` subdirectories have been 
modified by hand to refer to the versions of the modules and dependencies stored 
in src so that only testing related code needs to be stored in the test 
subdirectories. File extensions have been modified to `.f08` in keeping with the 
conventions used in this repository.

|----------------       |--------------     |------                          |
|`initGrid.fun`         |`initialisation`	|momentum grid setup (run first) |
|`initD0.fun`           |`initialisation`   |D0 green's fn setup (run second)|
|`initHybrid.fun`       |`initialisation`   |Hybridisation setup (run third) |
|`dispersions.fun`	    |`dispersions`		|fine and coarse grid dispersions|
