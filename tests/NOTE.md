#Generation of test routines

Code is generated from the files in test_fun using 
[funit](https://github.com/kleb/nasarb/tree/master/funit) plus a few necessary 
manual modifications such that it works (see NOTES.md in test_fun for more 
information). The resulting test suites are stored in test_code in directories 
corresponding to the relevent module.
